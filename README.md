## Purpose

Better science is open science and shared science. As a researcher in
cancer immunomics, I always spend much time in data cleaning in my every
project. However, there are a limited number of datasets available for
analysis. Most of them are very small with only a few patients/samples,
especially for immunotherapy datasets. This causing many works cannot
reproduce or have limited power. Therefore, I create this community
mantained project named **ImmuneDR** to host a curated immune resource
database in r format.

I think a curated database can speed up progress of researches in all
immune related projects and thus cancer patients have opportunities to
earlier benefit from our works. I hope all researchers studying
cancer/immunology can search, collect and submit published data to this
project and help maintain them.

All data will be stored in GitHub (when less than 1GB) and access
methods are provided to everyone for free.

Thanks.

## Submission

TODO: create an issue template for submission.

## Usage

TODO: create the first database for immune cell infiltration and treat
it as an example to show how to store data and use them.
